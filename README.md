# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Attah (he/him) - a 2nd-year **Computer Science student** who specializes in **Python** development with largely academic interests in **Java (surviving it)**, **MATLAB (can't stand it)** & **VBasic (no idea why we learned it)**. I occasionally venture into graphics and interface design as well. 

Here are the tools and technologies I work with:

ðŸ’¡ **I work on Python and Java-related projects in my free time both as a means of skills acquisition and as harmless fun (nerd alert!ðŸš¨ðŸ¤“)**
