# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Attah (he/him) - a 2nd-year **Computer Science student** who specializes in **Python** and **Java** development with largely academic interests in **MATLAB** and **VBasic**. I occasionally venture into graphics and interface design as well. 

Here are the tools and technologies I work with:
